# Requirements:
###### 1.Google Colab
###### 2.Open CV
###### 3.Keras
###### 4.Numpy
###### 5.Glob
###### 6.Matplotlib






# Dataset:
I used a dataset that contains 2 folders. Each of these folders contains mammography images.


# Segmentation Phase:
This phase focuses on detectioning masses in mammography images. In this project, I used U-net architecture technique to identify the mass in mammography images.U-Net architecture for image segmentation is an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with extensive medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging applications.
